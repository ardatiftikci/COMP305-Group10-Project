Completed Steps for Meeting 1:
1)Decided on the language (Java)
2)Talked about the problem.
3)Wrote code of game simulation.
TO DO:
1)Try to come up with an idea.
2)Convert the idea to pseudocode.

Completed Steps for Meeting 2: 
1) Analyzed the algorithm further. 
2) Created the algorithm for the base case simulation (test1).
TO DO:
1) Debug the written code. 

Completed Steps for Meeting 3: 
1) Created the algorithm for the test1,2 and 3.
2) Pruning is done.
3) Dynamic programming approach is used. 
TO DO:
1) Debug the written code for test2 (10,000 & 100,000). 

Completed Steps for Meeting 4: 
1) Did more analysis to reduce time spent in 10,000 and 100,000 cases.
2) Included hashsets to be more efficient. 
TO DO:
1) Reduce time spent in 10,000 and 100,000 cases 

Completed Steps for Meeting 5: 
1) Renovated the dynamic programming approach.
2) Reduced the time spent by including more pruning. 
3) Presentation is prepared halfway. 
4) Corrected and improved the commands in the code.
TO DO:
1) Improve Presentation

Completed Steps for Meeting 6:
1) First half of the presentation is finalized.
2) Text for second half of presentation is prepared.
3) Test cases is corrected and code is updated accordingly.
TO DO:
1) Complete Presentation
2) Beautify the code

Completed Steps for Meeting 7:
1) Presentation is completed.
2) Code is beautified.
